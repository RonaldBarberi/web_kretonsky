<h1>Application Web Kretonsky üñ•Ô∏èüìà</h1>

<p>
  In this project, you will find a WEB application created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Django. It is a portfolio where you will find the tools I am proficient in; additionally, you will be able to see   my experience and skills in various areas, all governed by programming.

  For running the web application, it is recommended to use Python 3.10.10. Additionally, if you encounter any issues with versioning, you can find the requirements.txt file in the 'static/config' directory.

  Thank you for checking out my project!
